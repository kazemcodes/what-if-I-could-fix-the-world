# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand test-driven-development before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides

**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |
| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |
| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |
| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |
| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |
| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:**
- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you
- You'd reference this again across projects
- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)
- Others would benefit

**Don't create for:**
- One-off solutions
- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere
- Project-specific conventions (put in project docs)
- Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it)

## Skill Types

### Technique
Concrete method with steps to follow

### Pattern
Way of thinking about problems

### Reference
API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation

## Directory Structure

```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)
    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed
```

**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`
- Max 1024 characters total
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use

## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

This applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills.

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.
Edit skill without testing? Same violation.

## Skill Creation Checklist (TDD Adapted)

**RED Phase - Write Failing Test:**
- [ ] Create pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures for discipline skills)
- [ ] Run scenarios WITHOUT skill - document baseline behavior verbatim
- [ ] Identify patterns in rationalizations/failures

**GREEN Phase - Write Minimal Skill:**
- [ ] Name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with only name and description
- [ ] Description starts with "Use when..." and includes specific triggers
- [ ] Clear overview with core principle
- [ ] Address specific baseline failures identified in RED
- [ ] Run scenarios WITH skill - verify agents now comply

**REFACTOR Phase - Close Loopholes:**
- [ ] Identify NEW rationalizations from testing
- [ ] Add explicit counters (if discipline skill)
- [ ] Build rationalization table from all test iterations
- [ ] Create red flags list
- [ ] Re-test until bulletproof

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Quick reference table
- [ ] Common mistakes section
- [ ] No narrative storytelling
- [ ] Supporting files only for tools or heavy reference

## Discovery Workflow

How future instances find your skill:

1. **Encounters problem** ("tests are flaky")
2. **Searches skills** (description matches)
3. **Scans overview** (is this relevant?)
4. **Reads patterns** (quick reference table)
5. **Loads example** (only when implementing)

**Optimize for this flow** - put searchable terms early and often.

## The Bottom Line

**Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.**

Same Iron Law: No skill without failing test first.
Same cycle: RED (baseline) → GREEN (write skill) → REFACTOR (close loopholes).
Same benefits: Better quality, fewer surprises, bulletproof results.

If you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills. It's the same discipline applied to documentation.
