**1404/01/13 AF | Late Morning**

The huge building looks like the Coliseum, but it is not like the pictures that he has seen, this one looks new and well maintained, the architecture is more intricate and detailed runes and shimmering symbols and gems are etched into the walls, the building is also much taller and grander, as if it could fit a small village inside.

He approaches the stall, the clerk looks up and sees Albert, he seems surprised to see someone dressed in such strange clothing, but he quickly recovers and greets Albert in a friendly manner and started speaking in an Italian sounding language. "English?" The clerk switches to something English sounding but is speaking in a thick French-German accent "Welcome senior, state you name and supporting partie. Thikkets ist 10 gold für private boxez, 5 gold für partie sponsored seatingues, and 2 gold für generale admission."

Albert is taken aback, "Um, Albert, and I don't have a supporting party, I just want to see the games." The clerk winces "Mo'suie very sorry seniour, but uncitizens ist not allowed seats in ze games. Wene haven lowa standing placies für uncitizens, ze price ist 10 silver but alen zenar sold out für the next few eventz."

Albert takes out his wallet, he has only a few credit cards and some cash, "I don't blieve you take bills?" The clerk looks at him with a mix of confusion and amusement, "Biuellz? Ze cans submit you complaints to ze publique senate official if ze haven ainen, but wene only accepten coinen here." Albert hands one of his credit cards to the clerk, he looks at it front and back and frowns. "Adventurer cards are not accepted here, you can withdraw your credits from your local branch." Albert asks, "Where I can buy some coins?" The clerks fums "Ze buies with ze coins, wene nein process ze guild credits here. Please leave." He looks at the crowd dressed in roman clothing and greets them with a bow. Albert is left standing there, feeling a mix of frustration and confusion. He has no idea how to get coins or how to navigate this new world, but he is determined to find a way to see the games and explore this strange new place. He decides to ask around and see if anyone can help him understand the currency and how to get some coins.

Albert wastes more time and the clerks shoos him away, one of the guards nearby notices and grabs Albert by the arm, "You there, you are causing a disturbance, you need to leave." Albert tries to explain that he just wants to see the games and that he doesn't understand the currency, but the guard is not interested in listening. "I don't care what you want, you need to leave now." The guard drags Albert away from the stall and throws him on the ground dozens of steps away.

A man holding a crate of fruits sees the commotion and helps Albert up, "You okay? The guards are jerks. You gotta be careful around here, they don't like outsiders." Albert responds, "Hi. I'm Albert, I just got here and I don't understand how things work." the man replies with a strange look "As long as you have a entry visa or work permit you are fine, they won't be able to do anything to you." Albert still confused, "And if I have none of those?" The man puts down the crate and pulls Albert back behind his stall, lowering his voice "If you have no proof of identity, they will execute you. The city is not nice to illegal immigrants. Especially if they speak barbarian languages, they must have spared you because you vaguely look Perisian." He keeps looking at Albert "More like Perisian-Perkakasan" Albert is shocked "So basically I'm a Mexican in Texas hah? The weather fits." He lets out a nervous chuckle. The man squints "We all start as illegal immigrants here, the last time they approved new citizens was 20 years ago. but if you work well the guild master might sponsor you for a work permit, that is if you are lucky and your criminal record is clean." Albert with a grim look in his face, rolling his eyes "Not this shit again."

**1404/01/13 AF | Noon**

Albert is carrying 2 stacked crates with sweat visible on his forehead. The fruit vendor was named Loric, he agreed to help Albert after he swore to keep his head down, he will get 5 copper if he doesn't drop anything and deliver the fruits unbruised. And he has to work until sun down. Albert was already swearing, he wasn't built for this, his entire life he was pressing keyboard buttons as far as he remembers. Sending ping packets and writing code now already seems like a distant memory or a bad dream he woke up from. He decides to take a break and sits on top of some stacked crates. He finds some leather bands inside his shoulder satchel and starts tying the watch device on his left wrist and hides it under his sleeve. He is bored. He pulled up his sleeve and started playing with the navigation device. He pressed one of the side buttons and it turned on. He pressed it again and it turned off. "Nice." He continued pressing all the buttons, he pressed the power button 5 times in a row and the device showed an interface "Enable developer mode?" Albert was surprised, "What the fuck?" He pressed the button to enable it and the device apparently rebooted and opened on a watchOS like launcher. "Is this Apple?", The device beeped and opened another interface "Rooting is disabled, contact manufacturer for OEM-unlocking keys." he pressed the only option "Okay". "Probably a knock-off Android-based Chinese flop. Like everything else we can buy in this economy." Another interface opened "Change system language to Mandarin(官话)?", The interface buttons were in Chinese, He pressed the left one and the Device turned Chinese. "Yep." He tried to find language settings, he found it after some of the settings were already changed. He chose "English (US)", "Was this made on Earth?". He now had some additional system apps. He turned on auto language translation in the Languages app and set default output language to "Latin (Old Roman variant)". "Wow, this is made for nerds."

Loric was standing in front of him, his hands on his waist. "I'm just taking a break." Loric surprised "You were speaking broken E-gen Barbarian until recently. What's wrong with you? Speak properly." Albert was taken aback, "It was just English though, like now." Loric was not convinced "No, it was not proper Erthen Barbarian. You were speaking like a Gay Barbarian, you need to speak properly if you want to work here." Albert was getting playfully annoyed "Why are you Gay? Who says I'm Gay, You are Gay. You are a transgenda." trying to sound Ugandan. Loric was not happy with that "How dare you associate that sin to me? That's something the royal bastard would say, you need to watch your tongue or I'll report you to the guild master." Albert composed himself, he wasn't speed running how fast you can get fired, "Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I'll speak properly from now on." Loric was still not satisfied "You better, or I'll make sure you never work in this city again." Albert nodded, feeling a mix of frustration and fear. He didn't want to lose his job. He decided to keep his head down and do his work, hoping that things would get better over time.

**1404/01/13 AF | Early Afternoon**

Roaring sounds were coming from the Coloseum's side. Albert looks up and sees a large crowd gathering around the entrance, people are cheering and shouting, some are even throwing coins into the air. He sees a group of guards trying to control the crowd, but they seem to be getting overwhelmed. Sales numbers went up and he was forced to work extra hard to keep up with the demand. He was running back and forth, carrying crates of fruits to the customers, some even bought bulk. He looked at Loric and saw him thriving in the chaos, he was shouting and laughing, and giving counter offers. He must be of those extroverted types that enjoy the hustle and bustle of the market. Albert on the other hand was struggling to keep up, he was getting tired and stressed, and he couldn't understand why people were so excited about the games. He had never been a fan of physical sports or competitions, he didn't see the appeal in them, his favorite competition was CTF games, and no one was computer nerd here, they didn't even have proper math, they counted in dozens and ones. Somehow a dozen was 12, but a dozen dozens was 100, and for 144 they just said "dozdozeno", after 20 they counted in 20s, 73 was literally "three-twenties-twelve-one" or "tridodozendozenuno" fucked up counting all around and a true Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia nightmare. That was the longest proper English word he knew and it definitely meant phobia of Hippos. "You are lost in yourself again, chup chup rush hour is ending." Loric said, "We need to finish the deliveries and then we can go home." Albert nodded, trying to focus on his work, but his mind was still racing with thoughts about the games and CTF challenge design. "So a dozen is 12 or 10 again?" Loric looked at him with amusement. "Yes. A dozen is a dozen or a dozen." Albert responded, "Of course it's a dozen or a _dozen_. Makes total sense," trying to sound sarcastic but Loric didn't get the joke "Exactly, you are getting it now." He was smiling for the first time all day. 

**1404/01/13 AF | Late Afternoon**

Albert got paid 7 copper pieces; Loric tipped him two extra for helping with the ledgers. "If you keep this up, I'll even up your pay to 10 coppers. Actually, here have a dozen for your first day." Loric handed him an extra 5. "Well, the translation system knows what a dozen is, I just can't figure it out." "Erthen Barbarian uses chaotic counting systems; that's how a dozen can be two numbers. Don't use it in the books." Loric said, "Some argue it is simpler than the Imperical Sun-Kissed Kingdom Math System, but we have to use proper math in official book keeping." Albert was now more confused "How can a citystate be a kingdom?" Loric was not sure how to explain it "The Sun-Kissed kingdom is a citystate, but it is also a kingdom, Officially its called the Holy Sun-Kissed Empire. Don't worry you get used to it, the senate can't always come to majority vote so they compromise." Albert not having it anymore "Is everything suffering form designed by committee issues? You have proper math but refuse to use it?", Loric sounded scared "I said keep your head down, you are speaking treason."

Loric tried to change the subject "So, you have a place to stay? Any friends or family to stay with? Your people live a long way from the kingdom, are you alone?" Albert was not sure how to respond, "Actually, I was born and raised in a village not so far from here, the local lord was a real piece of shit tyrant. My mom and I immigrated to the states near the Kingdom when I was a child. I grew up with high education, but the economy got bad, and we really suffered during the corona incident." He tried to vaguely adapt his childhood memories to this world. "Yes, eclipses are always bad for business," he said, sounding sympathetic. "Right, yes, eclipse." Albert said his goodbyes and promised to show up again at dawn for hauling spice crates.

**1404/01/13 AF | Late Afternoon**

Albert exited the now-closing market near the Colosseum. According to Loric, the city was named "Solcaryn" and divided into four quadrants, his current location being near the inner edge of the southwestern outer city, one dubbed "The Commercial District." the northeastern district didn't have a proper name but colloquially was referred to as "The Slums". Loric refused to give any information about the inner and western side of the city citing that it is "TBA or Taboo" to know for non citizens what exists over there. Loric gave him directions to two places in the slums, one was a tavern named Boar's Trotter and an Inn called The Rusty Anchor, both were cheap and known to be safe for people like him, whatever Loric meant by that. He was warned to not eat at The Rusty Anchor, saying that the patrons become thug punch bags and got extorted out of their money for protection. apparently these two were close enough to the inner city for the guards to care but not too much to do proper investigations, a sweet spot for "People like him". Albert decided that Loric actually thinks he is gay and decided to keep the autotranslation settings to 'accent:strict' and 'always-on'.

As he walked with Loric to the edge of the commercial district, they had to separate. "Make sure to have a room by twilight. The slums are very dangerous at night. You don't want to be out there when the creatures of the night come out." Albert was not sure if Loric was trying to sound whimsical, was joking or just too cautious, but he took the advice seriously. He found the tavern very easily using his watch navigation system after setting it to 'safe autorouting'. It even conveniently came with an omni-search tool. The air was cold, damp and tasted like salt, it suddenly changed after two winding turns marking his entry to the slums. Albert was too focused on his watch to notice the change.

**1404/01/13 AF | Late Afternoon**

A stout barkeep glanced up from behind the counter as Albert entered, wiping a tankard with a rag, his voice carrying a welcoming rumble over the din. "Evening, stranger, what'll it be? Stew's fresh, two coppers a bowl." He sat the tankard down, eyeing Albert with casual curiosity.

"Some stew would be great, put some bread to its side if you have any." The barkeep nodded, and Albert was eating in seconds. They exchanged some small talk. The barkeep's name was Harlan; he had a salt-and-pepper beard and sleeves rolled up over sinewy arms. He was very proud of his stew, and it actually tasted good, though it was no different from noodles without the noodles. Harlan said, "I haven't seen new faces 'round these parts, especially people like you." Leaning on the counter, wiping his hands on his apron as the stew fire crackled softly behind him. "What do you mean by people like me? I'm not gay you know?" Harlan looked at him with a mix of confusion and amusement, "Before you, someone with the same accent came in here, he was a nice guy, maybe a bit too clingy. Apparently he was fond of mustaches like mine a lot. He also liked eggs and nuts, but we only offer stew," said Harlan, sounding too serious. Albert didn't continue the conversation; he ate in silence and paid two coppers. He now had 8 in his coin pouch. "A round of ale to wash it down?" Harlan asked, "No thanks, I want to get home before sun down." Harlan nodded "You don't want to be out there after dark without being drunk, trust me." Albert nodded, "I'll get there fast, I'll have ale next time." Harlan smiled, "Sure thing, see you around new face." Albert left the tavern and headed towards the inn, he was still trying to process everything that had happened that day.

**1404/01/13 AF | Twilight**

The sun was setting very fast, Albert hastened himself to marathon mode to reach the inn before it got dark, someone with a familiar voice called out to him "Hey stranger, you look lost, need some help?" Albert turned around and saw Loric pushing a fruit cart. "Hey Loric, do you also work at night?" Loric looked at him in suspicion "I know my faces stranger and I work here from noon to night. You are new here." Albert's face turned pale. "Loric" continued, "The inn nearby has good cheap prices, great for people like you." Albert responded, "I know, Loric. I was heading there. See you at dawn." Loric nodded, "See you at dawn, Albert, and be careful out there. The night is dangerous." Albert nodded, feeling a mix of fear and anxiety. He started moving faster, after a turn he heard another voice "Evenin', stranger. Headin' somewhere in a hurry? Streets get tricky at dusk 'round here." He didn't look and almost started running, jumping inside the inn completely out of breath with the taste of salt in his mouth.

**1404/01/13 AF | Late Evening**

Pushing inside, Albert was met by a haze of pipe smoke and the murmur of low voices at scarred wooden tables, the air thick with the tang of cheap ale and unwashed travelers huddling in corners for anonymity. Behind a battered bar, a wiry woman with a sharp gaze and cropped graying hair looked up from polishing a tankard, her keen eyes assessing Albert in an instant. "Evenin', stranger," she says curtly, her voice like gravel underfoot as she sets the tankard down with a thud. "Lookin' for a room? Two coppers gets ya a cot and quiet—ain't much, but it's yours." Albert nodded without saying a word and paid 2 coppers. He took a key to room number 7, second floor on the right.

Albert got to his room. His mind was running like a loose husky. Something was very wrong; things repeated in strange ways. He was a stranger to everyone, but all of them knew about 'people like him.' Someone must be fucking with him. He was sure of it. He was thinking of creating a fantasy world bingo card on his way to the tavern, but definitely he wouldn't put things that happened on it. Suddenly the genre went wrong when he left Loric.

Albert started playing with his watch, getting access to the launcher was huge, the device had so many features and calling it a navigation device was an insult. He played with the translation app, he found out the tts engine was set to gender neutral, but the voice was very feminine, he tried voice samples from all available voices and found one that sounded close to him. But still from what he found out if he learned the local language, his accent would still sound vaguely gay. He played with the accent settings, apparently 'strict' was supposed to make the translation more accurate but it made unexpected assumptions about his culture, he was no communist. He set it to 'formal' and it sounded better, he kept it on 'formal'. This should put people off of his back. Sounding formal was better than letting people assume things about you. He found an AI-powered language learning app, it wasn't mere AI slop, he could ask questions in his mind and the app would tell him what it was, it also had a feature to not translate certain words, meant to help you practice the words you already learned. He immediately set 'dozen' to not translate, maybe the two words were different very slightly in speech and were missed by the app. He somehow had 6 coppers left. He started with 'a dozen,' which clearly was 12 when he received them in a batch of 7 and 5, and he spent 4, so he should have 8 left, but he had 6.

The night was filled with more discoveries and aha moments, he had a habit of staying up late and didn't remember when he was asleep.
