**1404/01/14 AF | Late Morning**

Someone was breaking his door down. Albert jumped out of bed and ran to the door. He opened it and saw a woman was standing there. Why did he think it was a man? She had long hair and clearly had makup and was wearing a dress, but sounded manly for some reason. "You missed breakfast and work hours, get out an' leave before the guards sweep the S-area." She handed him a fanny pack and threw him out. "You can keep the key, I choose to trust you with it. If they catch you show them the key, but if you dare to not come back and pay for two nights, They WILL catch you. Capish?" She said and hauled him out like he was made of feathers.

Albert was walking like he was drunk, the way she held him almost crushed his bones and he was dealing with a temporary aphasia according to the watch. He routed his way back to Loric's stall, but for some reason by the time he got into the commercial area, it was noon, apparently the navigation was drunk too, it showed the same streets and alleys multiple times and he had to go through them multiple times, if he went back to find the path manually, the route was navigated in reverse and the calculated time would change by minutes and sometimes hours.

"Did you get lost on the way? I tried to help you last night you know." Loric said as Albert approached his stall. "Why did you run away? Insulting a drunk man is a bad idea you know? If you continue to be an annoying ass, not only you will get nightmares but you know what will happen to you then."

The lecture went on for a few minutes As The Romans were added to the crowd. Loric looked at one of the guards and shouted at Albert to start hauling, his wage was reduced to half a dozen for the rest of the day. The work was exactly the same as yesterday, only that Albert now had to clean write the books using the fucked math.

Albert took a bite from one of the apples, he crossed off a dozen and added it to another, the result came out as dodozen which he traced to be 22 on the other side. Strange. He dug deeper and found out that apparently half a dozen was 5 to 7, and a full dozen was calculated mostly as 10, but sometimes the numbers added up to 12 or 14. Debts were paid in whole units, the value of a whole unit starting as 14 owed and reduced to 12 or 10, dozens resolved to 12s or 10s, the citizens, merchants and other non-citizens got a different deal depending on which side of the deal they were on. "So that's how they calculate the hidden tax, Dozen has 3 sets of meanings, but only two are official and are in the 'clean' books." He concluded that the value of a dozen was decided based on personal judgment, and using the right value changed your market layer. He had a new sense of what the black market was, they somehow paid 40% tax but not at the same time.

**1404/01/14 AF | Early Evening**

Albert was finished with the books. Some day workers were getting their wages and switching jobs. They got paid 1 cooper piece per sun-slice, the day was divided into a dozen sun-slices which Albert found out very accurately mapped to Earth hours. Some worked in two 7 hour shifts during the beforenoon and afternoon, and got paid a dozen cooper pieces. Some got scammed and were paid 10, some others were more thorough or intelligent and were paid 14. Most could only work for half a day and got paid half a dozen coopers just like him.

"Rush hour is starting, get back to hauling." Loric shouted at him and Albert raised his head. "You know the books but you are lazy. Why not try your hand at the stall this time? You are not cut out for hauling." Albert was a little happy, he could handle the crowd for a couple of hours.

**1404/01/14 AF | Late Evining**

Albert was doing pretty good at the stall and the afternoon profits increased by about 30%; he judged people with scrutiny and calculated the dozens as 10 just for the Romans, all others got 14 and no one even complained. Loric seemed to be happy with the results; the customers liked him too much, they asked for his name and he said "Albert with the libertarian party." Most approved, others assured him that he was very brave with his choice, others thought that he was crazy or dumb.

He was getting a headache from jumbling the numbers and was getting slower; he had to write down all the sales in a ledger. Loric didn't do that yesterday while doing sales, but Albert had to do it today. "That old man is a piece of..." "Albert from libertarian party." He looked back at the speaker; one of the guards was looking him down. "It's officer Gaius, we are very happy that you are interested in switching to our side, make sure to register your name with the party tomorrow, we need as many fine gentlemen as yourself we can get." Albert swallowed the lump in his throat and nodded. "I will, I will. Officer Gaius." His hand was firmly shaken and Officer Gaius left without saying anything else. 'Shit. Shit. Shit. No party from now on.'

His reputation instantly plummeted and the 14 dozens became offending to most; others just refused and left. He had to return the prices to normal. The profits plummeted and Loric's face was angry again. "You are treating everyone like pirates; we'll lose customers this way. Step aside, you are on hauling duty again." He looked at the murmurs around the stall. "Actually here take half a dozen and leave." His coin pouch now held 11 cooper pieces. "Make sure to eat your breakfast, the Inn lady must have liked you so much." He was pointing at his fanny pack. It opened to a huge bacon sandwich. Loric said the sandwich cost half a dozen.

Albert started running back to the Inn, horror genre wasn't his thing.

**1404/01/14 AF | Twilight**

Albert was losing to the sun; he was let go one sun-piece earlier. Maybe the sun was faster on this side of the city? He nodded to the cart Loric, who eyed him strangely on his fast walk. He was getting closer to the Inn, the alleys seemed to have a rising slope; he was getting tired but found the place and went in anyways. The inn was pretty empty, the innkeeper was cleaning the counter and a few customers were sitting at the tables. "Welcome back, baby. I hope you had a good day." The innkeeper said with a smooch. "I did, I did. I just want to take a shower and go to sleep." Albert said; he was exhausted. "Of course, the room is ready for you." He handed over the fanny pack and paid 6 copper pieces, he had 5 left. "I hope my baby is not too tired to stay a little longer." Albert could have sworn that ~~his~~ her words contained the :3 emoji. "They call me the innkeep, but you can call me Olena." Albert nodded and went to his room. He had some ideas to try with the watch.
