**2026/07/02 CE | Late Evening**

Albert started flapping the neck of his sweaty undershirt. It was another warm night after a series of dry, cold nights. "Why the fuck is it warm in the middle of the winter?" he looked to his left 'the room radiator?', he turned his rotating office chair, lifting his left foot to touch it with his ...., he turned to the right, frantically pressing a key binding. A tab opened. "palm of foot in English." The page started turning, taking more than a second, he looked at his left monitor,

'Is mom on Instagram again?' he sighed. The page loaded "sole? the sole??? 'kay.", he felt the sweat on his body, 'the radiator', he turned left putting the sole of his left foot on... 'it's too far' he gave the chair a push by throwing his body weight. The sole of his foot touched the radiator. The warmth on the sole of his foot felt good. He turned more and added his right foot. 'It feels right... why the fuck am I warm and cold at the same time?' He scoffed. Another deep sigh. "Is the internet down again?" shouted his mom from the other room. "No, Mum, scroll them slower and it will work." He shouted back. She didn't answer. the palm of his feet started burning 'what was it again?' looking right 'sole of feet? sole??? hmm' the burns started to hurt. He withdrew the feet putting them down on cold ceramic flooring. 'oh that's why it's cold' he moved forward on the chair. His right hand reaching for the radiator valve... 'which way was it again?' He tried remembering by feel, imagining a shower valve, his hand turning in closing motion. Opening his eyes 'left or right? ... whatever' he started turning the valve by feel, it turned a few revolutions -finally getting tight. He got back to his desk on the chair. 'still warm' he turned completely around and opened the window slightly. 'ah fresh air' he took a deep breath. back to business. He continued reading. 'Luke my man, you gotta do something about those goats.' After a few minutes, 'Sure, he needs clothing, but is goat leather gonna do it? the author lazily wrote him as a tanner boy?' ... 'He is bald now? that's not water' .... "Al, is your room window open again?" "No, it's not mom." "Close your window." "Mom, my window is not open." She didn't answer. Back to reading. 'Is he stupid or just written stupid? I guess a murderhobo in the making.' He changed the tab. 'sole of your foot.' Tab closed. Holding control and pressing tab a few times to reach the anime tab. He continued watching the top rated trash isekai fantasy of last season.

'ping is stable' he paused the loading video. 'let it buffer for a bit' he got up and went directly for the fridge. A chunk of crunchy frozen bread in hand. He started taking bites, leaning on the kitchen window, peeping through neighbor windows. He went back to his room, closing the door behind him. 'Wow, the air decided that it wants to be cold now.' He put on his hoodie, sweatpants, and flip-flops. A cool multi-purpose fit he was fond of. Coming back to his video. he pressed space. A loud sound played for a split second. Space again. 'Shit, shit, shit!' He connected his Bluetooth headphones again. 'Bah, only 13 seconds loaded? The internet is shit tonight even with a stable ping.' With a press of a key combination, the computer was shutting down. He got up, the chair creaking. 'Back to reading more on my phone.' He got on the bed and continued reading after scrolling down for half a minute. 'Andre is just a moral bitch, he should learn some from Taylor, if I was there I'd fuck her dirty.' He closed the book eyeing the other already downloaded 12 volumes... 'is 13 out yet? his fiver was good' He started reading the trilogy, as half-finished series had bitten him before. 'Bruh, it's been 8 years—just stop writing more. I stopped reading after the second one last year.' The author's first and third series were bangers, not so much the second one. 'But the dude has made a good multiverse.' He shrugged and opened a full web series. 'Bruh, what the fuck? 12,568 pages? Are these people crazy? How many volumes is that?' He did some quick math. 'About 21? Twenty fucking volumes?' He searched Google. 'Oh, it's 7, but those volumes must be huge if ever printed.' He tapped on the series subreddit link. 'hmm this one is since 2013', 'Oh, they are releasing the first volume as a rewritten story? Welp, goodbye till 2036!' He deleted the epub file. that one wasn't technically legal. He felt a burden removed. 'Licensing is important, man.' He opened another file—a cultivation story. 'A wuxia novel?! but the author's name was English sounding. What was it again?' He searched Google, but the internet was disconnected. 'The high ping nation attacks again!', He swiped down, and down, and then down again. 'It's really down, isn't it?' He got up and saw that the PC is off. He shrugged. 'Shit, that old-ass thing takes a few minutes to boot even on Linux.' He pressed the power button and went to the kitchen for another crispy frozen bread chunk, looking out of the kitchen window. 'Dude, only if I had those leveling systems... Real life is boring, no feedback loop. I guess God wasn't paying attention when he made ADHD people.' He realized he'd just made a joke and chuckled softly. 'But for real, dude...' He looked out of the window again. a few lights were on. 'These people are crazy, man. Five times a day? If I were God I'd at least talk back once in a while, but I guess He likes us guessing.' He glanced at the router LEDs on his way back.

'That's new, we have duplicate icmp packets now?' he took a quick look at the man pages, 'duplicate packets are a sign of network congestion, so maybe it's just the router shitting itself.'

'router's fine.' He leaned back, the chair creaking. 'I guess it's just the ISP's problem.' He sighed and went back to bed. 'I'll just read more on my phone.' 'Damn, this one is actually good, shoutout to that will what guy.' He continued reading. Light came through the window, the birds were chirping. 'Damn, it's already morning? I guess I should sleep now.' He closed the book and put the phone beside his bed. 'The internet better fix itself or those ISP guys will get some phishing emails, someone's gotta fix the routers if not them.' He turned off the light and went to sleep. His last thought before sleeping was about how broken the world was. 'What if I'd be isekaied? Yeah, a banger way to go, but truck-kun hasn't been a friend so far'.

You do not wake up.

You realize you are already sitting.

The surface beneath you is warm, solid, and not from any world you remember. Around you, voices murmur in languages you half-recognize. No one looks surprised to see you.

Someone slides a cup across the table.

"Rough landing?"

Albert looks around, he had lucid dreamed before, but this one was too weird.
