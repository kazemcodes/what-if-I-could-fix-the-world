He blinks, and the haze sharpens just a fraction—the table under your hands is etched with faint, glowing runes that pulse like distant stars, and the air hums with a low, ethereal vibration that seeps into your bones. The murmurs around you come from scattered figures: a hooded silhouette nursing a steaming mug, a translucent form flickering like a faulty hologram, all seated at mismatched tables in this vast, floating chamber where walls shimmer with indigo voids. The place is held up by huge straight and arching supports. No windows, no doors, The vast area outside being just an endless drift of shimmering lights beyond, not much different to images of a supernova.

The one who spoke—a wiry woman with skin like polished obsidian and eyes that gleam silver—leans in slightly, her voice carrying a casual lilt as if this is just another shift at a dingy cafe. "You dozed off, sleep deprivation? Seen that look a hundred times. Name's Olthara. You?" She taps the cup toward you again, its contents swirling with an iridescent liquid that smells faintly of rain and forgotten dreams.

**0001/01/01 AF | Early Morning**

Albert takes a cautious sip, the liquid cool and oddly comforting, like a memory of a place he can't quite recall. The taste is complex—hints of something sweet and something bitter, like nostalgia mixed with regret. He sets the cup down, his mind racing to make sense of where he is and how he got here.

Olthara watches him for a moment, her expression unreadable. "You're not the first to end up here after a rough landing. This place... it's a waystation of sorts. A crossroads for those who've been torn from their worlds, whether by accident or design." She gestures around the chamber, where the other patrons seem to exist in their own bubbles of reality, some lost in thought, others engaged in quiet conversations that fade in and out like echoes.

One of them flickers. Olthara continues "Even ethereal beings like him end up here sometimes. He's been here for a while, though. Doesn't talk much." She nods toward the translucent figure, who gives a faint, almost imperceptible nod in return.

Albert's mind is a whirlwind of questions, but one stands out above the rest: "How do I get back? I need to find my way home."

Olthara's eyes darken slightly, and she takes a slow sip from her own cup before responding. "Getting back isn't as simple as finding a door or a portal. This place... it's not just a stopover. It's a nexus between realities where the veil is thin, and sometimes, the paths back to your world can be hidden or blocked. But there are ways to navigate it, if you know where to look." She leans in  closer with a sly grin that Albert is too lost in thought to notice, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I'm a bit of a guide around here. I know the ins and outs of this place, but this place isn't designed to find you a way back. It's designed to help you move on." sounding like a showman selling a used car. The type that taps on the roof of the car and exclaim "This bad boy can run for another 100,000 miles!".

"Move on? What does that mean? I want to go continue reading my books, do you know how many half-finished series I have?"

Olthara's expression softens for a moment, and she gives a small, understanding nod. "I'm sorry. That is just how reincarnation works." She is holding a thick folder that holds many documents and sub folders. She looks at one of her colleagues, she quietly mumbles that he's supposed to be into this stuff. Olthara continues with a loud cough, taking a sip of some steaming blue liquid in her mug. "But sometimes, when you're torn from that world, you have to find a new one. Our staff has found you a new world, it's not too different from the one you came from, but it has its own additional unique quirks that you kept asking God about. You know the man upstairs is busy, right? He doesn't have time to answer every question you have about the universe. But I can tell you that this new world is full of adventure, mystery, and endless possibilities. You might even find some of those half-finished stories of yours come to life there." She gives him a reassuring smile.

"Does it come with anime cat girls?" Albert asks, trying to find a silver lining in the situation. Olthara's smile falters for a moment, and she gives him a look that says "Really? That's what you're asking about right now?" before responding. "Well, we can arrange a special delivery just for you." She winks, and Albert can't help but let out a satisfied chuckle at the absurdity of the situation. Despite the uncertainty and fear she radiates, there's a glimmer of hope in her words. Maybe this new world isn't so bad after all. Maybe it's an opportunity for a fresh start, a chance to create new stories and experiences.
Albert takes a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. "Okay, I'm willing to give it a shot. But I want to know more about this new world. What can you tell me about it?"

"Well, the world is called Atherfall, the place looks like pre-Christianity era Earth, but with a twist. It's a world where magic exists, and mythical creatures roam freely. Humans and other races coexist, navigating a landscape filled with swords and sorcery. The society is divided into various factions and Kingdoms, each with their own agendas and conflicts. It's a world full of danger and intrigue, but also one where you can find friendship, love, and adventure." Olthara's eyes sparkle with excitement as she describes the world, sounding like she is reading from a practiced script, Albert can't help but feel a sense of curiosity and anticipation building inside him.

Albert nods, trying to process all the information. "It sounds... interesting. But how do I get there? Is there a portal or something?" Olthara's expression turns serious, and she leans in closer. "Jumping from I want to go home straight to the main course?" she smiles victoriously, "The committee allowed us to give you an OP start and gave you unbound growth potential but they also said that you have to be careful not to mess the place up too much down there. The world is already in a fragile state, and we don't want the bells alarming by introducing too much chaos." She gives him a stern look, emphasizing the importance of being cautious.

Albert nods, "But I can have some fun, right?" Olthara's smile returns, "Of course! You can explore, make friends, and have all sorts of adventures. Just remember to be mindful of your actions and how they might affect the world around you. It's a delicate balance, but I'm sure you'll do fine." She gives him a reassuring pat on the head before standing up to attend to other patrons. "Press that red button on the table when you're ready..." Albert smashes the button, and hears breaking sounds and his hands shiver from the electrical zap. The world around him blurs and distorts, and he feels a sensation of falling through space. The last thing he sees is the terrified face of Olthara. 

When the sensation subsides, he finds himself standing in a new environment, the air thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the sound of birds chirping in the distance. He looks around, taking in his surroundings, and realizes that he's no longer in the waystation. He's somewhere else entirely, somewhere that feels both familiar and foreign at the same time.

**1404/01/13 AF | Late Morning**

Albert looks around, his first sensation is the rush of hot and dry air to his face, murmurs of people speaking in a language he doesn't understand, and the sight of a bustling marketplace filled with colorful stalls and people dressed in medieval-looking clothing and a few dressed in slick Roman garments. The architecture is reminiscent of Rome, he sees a huge arching building towering above, keeping the place under its shadow. He sees one group heading to the building carrying crates of supplies with great haste and another group haggling over the price of fresh produce at a nearby stall. The atmosphere is lively and vibrant.

Albert takes a look at himself, his slick black drip looking hella out of place, but a number of the Roman-looking patrons are sizing him up and whispering to each other, clearly intrigued by his appearance. He notices that he has a small satchel slung over his shoulder, and when he opens it, he finds a few items inside: a small notebook filled with scribbled notes and drawings, a pen, several vials filled with twisting and shimmering liquids, and a strange device that looks like a cross between a compass and a pocket watch with optional handles for a wrist band. The device has a small screen that displays a map of the area, with a blinking dot indicating his current location. "Hell yeah, I can work with this" Albert thinks to himself, feeling a surge of excitement and curiosity about the new world he's found himself in. He decides to explore the marketplace and see what kind of opportunities and adventures await him in this strange new place.

A vendor selling fresh fruits and vegetables catches his eye, the Romans walk towards Albert, he sees a well-built stall dressed in red and white stripes of cloth, a man dressed in formal clerk attire stands behind the counter, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed shining metal helmet. Albert ponders for a moment, and sees opportunity in all directions.
