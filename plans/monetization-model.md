# Monetization Model: Hybrid Subscription + Credits

## Overview

A hybrid monetization model combining subscription tiers for predictable revenue with a credit system for flexibility. This approach addresses the limitations of credit-only models (mental friction, unpredictable costs) while maintaining accessibility for casual users.

---

## Why Hybrid Over Credit-Only?

### Problems with Credit-Only Model
1. **Mental Friction:** Users constantly calculate "can I afford this action?"
2. **Unpredictable Costs:** Users don't know their monthly spend
3. **Decision Paralysis:** "Should I spend credits on this?"
4. **Barrier to Flow:** Breaks immersion during gameplay

### Hybrid Solution
- **Subscriptions** provide unlimited core gameplay
- **Credits** unlock premium features and flexibility
- **Best of both worlds:** Predictable revenue + flexible usage
